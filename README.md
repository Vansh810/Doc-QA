# Doc QA

**Doc QA** is a Python project designed to answer questions based on the contents of a document. Using LangChain, OpenAI's language models, and Chroma for vector storage, this project allows you to query any document and receive precise answers generated by a language model.

## Features

- **Document Loader**: Loads various document types.
- **Text Chunking**: Splits documents into manageable chunks for efficient querying.
- **Embeddings with OpenAI**: Converts text chunks into vector embeddings.
- **Vector Storage**: Stores embeddings in a vector database (Chroma) for similarity search.
- **Question Answering**: Retrieves the most relevant chunks and generates an answer using OpenAIâ€™s language model.
